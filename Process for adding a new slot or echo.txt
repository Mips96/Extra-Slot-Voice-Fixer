This is the process I use to add a new slot (whether that's a costume or an echo fighter) to Smash Ultimate. It's unpolished and only for my own benefit, but I'm throwing it into this repo in case anyone else needs it.

1. Download the mod you want to add.

2. [ECHO FIGHTER ONLY] Temporarily move/rename the ui folder; it will be handled later.

3. Open the mod in reslotterGUI and change the slot(s) to whatever you want, as long as the desired slot is not currently in use. The output will be created as a new mod folder.
3a. [ECHO FIGHTER ONLY] (Optional, but recommended) Start from slot c100 to keep echo fighters distinct from normal costume slots.
3b. Compare the output to the original mod folder. If the mod uses anything that doesn't transfer over to the output (such as a plugin.nro or /sound/bank/narration folder), decide whether or not it should be copied over manually.

4. [ECHO FIGHTER ONLY] Rename the ui folder back to ui, copy it to the output, manually rename the slots in ui to use 00-07 if they're not already named accordingly (if it's a full replacement/echo, they probably are), and use Bulk Rename Utility to rename everything in the ui folder to use the new character's name (e.g. change all "koopa" to "midbus").

5. Copy the new mod folder to your SD card if you haven't already done so.

6. Open CSS Manager and change the Amount of Colors for the desired character.
6a. [ECHO FIGHTER ONLY] Duplicate the base character to create the echo slot. Change the Echo Fighter and Fighter Type fields as needed for both the base and echo characters (use Peach+Daisy as an example). Change other fields for the echo fighter as desired.
6b. Save the layout, click Open Save Directory, and copy the three files into a separate mod titled something like "CSS (Required)". Make sure the folder structure is correct!

7. If the mod includes custom audio, drag and drop the mod folder onto Extra Slot Voice Fixer to fix the audio. If not, you can skip this step.
